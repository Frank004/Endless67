# v0.0.50

## Unified Coin Counter Component
- Refactored the Coin Counter UI into a reusable component (`src/UI/HUD/CoinCounter.js`).
- Implemented unified visual style (background, sprite digits, formatting) for both the Gameplay HUD and the Store.
- Removed ad-hoc coin UI logic from `Store.js` and `HUDManager.js` to eliminate duplication.
- Ensured consistent formatting (k, m, b) across all screens.

## Technical Improvements
- **Cleanup System Refactor**: Centralized cleanup logic to improve scene transitions and memory management.
- **Store Logic**: Improved Store initialization and profile synchronization.
- **Version**: Bumped to v0.0.50.
